	<h2>Analysis</h2>
	<h3>What can this map tell us about Settled and Unsettled spaces?</h3>
	<h4>Undefined Boundaries</h4>
	<p>
		This map shows us first that these named locations did not have fully defined boundaries. They
		ebbed and flowed. These spaces were based more on the relationship between spaces, the
		relationship between spaces and people, and the relationships between people, rather than a
		specific place.
	</p>
	<h4>Boundaries Based on People and Actions, Not Location Place</h4>
	<p>
		In one of the only outside references to the East Bottoms in research about Lawrence, the author
		states that the East Bottoms were contained to the 7th/8th streets between Delaware and
		Pennsylvania
		<a href="#footnote-1">[1]</a>.
	</p>
	<p>
		However, looking at the map, we can see, for example, that most mentions of the East Bottoms are
		between <b>Delaware</b> and
		<b>New Jersey</b> from east to west, and between
		<b>Winthrop/7th</b> and <b>Warren/9th</b> streets north to south.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are references to the East Bottoms outside the northern city limits (at the time) across
		the railroad tracks, and as far south Berkley/10th street. There are mentions of the East
		Bottoms as far west as Connecticut street.
	</p>
	<p>
		This indicates that what was called the East Bottoms had more to do with the <b>people</b>
		associated with, or the
		<b>actions</b> performed by people in, these areas.
	</p>
	<p>
		The East Bottoms was home to multiple illegal economies, especially joints that served alcohol
		and “house-of-ill-repute” occupied by sex workers. The East Bottoms was also home to violence,
		drunkenness, and murder. Thus, any area east of Massachusetts could be called the “East Bottoms”
		depending on the actions and people that were there.
	</p>
	<h4>Spaces Defined as Physically and Morally Detrimental</h4>
	<p>Unsettled spaces were considered detrimental, both physically and morally.</p>
	<p>
		When physically described, newspaper writers used words like “dirty,” “diseased,” or
		“underbelly” to refer to the location. The dwellings spaces were referred to as “shacks”
		“shantys,” “hell hole,” and “dismantled.”
	</p>
	<p>
		But more than the assumed physical decrepit-ness of the space, these locations were also seen as
		morally deplorable. “Bottoms” locations were not unique to Lawrence. There was a Kansas City
		East Bottoms and a Topeka Bottoms as well. “Bottoms” areas usually consisted of low-lying land,
		often near water or marshes. This type of land, at the time, was believed to produce “miasma”
		(noxious “bad” air). This miasma could cause physical disease but also could produce moral
		turpitude and criminal pathology. It’s not surprising, then, that these locations were often
		identified by the crimes committed there. Clicking through the datapoints, the locations refer
		to stabbings, shootings, violence, pan-handling, and “joints.”
	</p>
	<p>
		In addition, this area of town was mostly reserved for industrial or extractive industries as
		well as the railroad. No cultural or beautiful or public sites dotted this landscape. The point
		is, the unsettled-ness of the location itself could potentially degrade a population—after all,
		why would they live in a place like the East Bottoms if they were moral upright citizens?
	</p>
	<p>
		The East Bottoms, and other areas within the East Bottoms, like the Bad Lands, were seen as the
		underbelly of Lawrence, lying on low land by the river, susceptible to disease, miasma,
		dirtiness (especially with so much flooding) and moral and spiritual degradation. The newspapers
		often called for a complete tear down of these buildings and dwellings, and, by extension it’s
		people.
	</p>
	<h3>What can this map tell us about Settled and Unsettled people?</h3>
	<p>
		Similar to the land itself, the people who lived in these spaces were considered naturally
		irreligious, immoral, criminally-minded paupers (paupers specifically referred to a population
		that the city or county must continually financially support. Paupers were believed to be lazy
		and indigent, unable to support themselves and thus a drain on the community). In over 300 data
		points, of which these 54 are a sampling, no person is ever referred to with any kind or
		respectful language (except in irony). At best, members of these communities were objects of
		pity. When trying to trace people attached to these spaces, I found that they were only legible
		in police records (printed in the newspaper), insanity records, and criminal court case
		documents. Their stories are either completely hidden—pushed under the rug as an embarrassment
		to the town—or sensationalized. Whether hidden or decried, it is very hard to determine anything
		“real” or “actual” about these community members.
	</p>
	<p>
		These populations were also heavily racialized. One can see in these 54 points how often the
		term “negro” is used to describe the population in these spaces. By at least 1918, there is also
		a brief mention to a “Mexican section” of the East Bottoms (I believe between Henry/8th and
		Warren/9th). Occasionally, white community members are mentioned, but they are often portrayed
		as entering the East Bottoms for entertainment, as opposed to living within the confines of
		these spaces.
	</p>
	<p>
		It is difficult to tell from newspaper coverage whether the people were tainted by the location,
		or if the location was tainted by the people. I postulate that it was both/and, not either/or.
		The presumed criminality of the people impacted the view of the location; the location and its
		poverty, the cheapness and flimsy-ness of the dwellings, added to the perception that the people
		were morally and physically ill.
	</p>
	<p>
		The fact that Lawrence so readily celebrates the pioneers of its history, it is not surprising
		that these community members, and their community spaces, continue to be ignored. This map seeks
		to mitigate the violence of these early Lawrence newspapers who dismissed these populations as
		pitiable, criminal, embarrassments in an otherwise civilized and “settled” free town.
	</p>
	<h3>What do the Sanborn Maps add to the data points?</h3>
	<p>The Sanborn maps add a fascinating perspective to these locations.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			It demonstrates the connection between built spaces and the derogatory language of
			unsettlement. One can see that the east segment of Lawrence has very few dwellings made of
			material aside from framework (the yellow dwellings). Framework was the simplest, cheapest,
			and least sturdy of building material at the time. It was used to put up haphazard or
			impermanent structures. It was the first material used for building, never the last. It was
			put up in order to be torn down and replaced. While the populations living in these framework
			dwellings were by no means “unhoused” in the way we understand the term today, they were
			precariously housed. Framework houses could be easily destroyed; the members of these
			communities were eking out a living in a building considered—by virtue of its material—to be
			temporary.
		</li>
		<li>
			Because the Sanborn maps show what the buildings were made out of, we can begin to match
			derogatory language to particular structures, helping historians determine what was considered
			“acceptable” housing and “unacceptable” housing.
		</li>
		<li>
			The Sanborn maps allow us to see what surrounded these communities and how close they were to
			the edge of city limits. It’s no surprise that indivdiuals being chased by the police would
			run through the East Bottoms—they could come out on the other side of Delaware street, right
			near forests, rivers, dense shrubs, and farmland. We can see how close these neighborhoods
			were to railroads and factories. We can also see that the East Bottoms was not limited to
			streets. It extended to “unmapped” areas, outside city limits. An unmapped area remains “wild”
			a home only for “savage” and dangerous people.
		</li>
	</ol>
	<h3>What can this map tell us about the Modern Period</h3>
	<p>
		One of the most important things this map shows is that the same places that were considered
		“unsettled”—with all the derogatory language that goes along with that including dirty,
		criminal, lazy, poor, immoral, irreligious, temporary, wild, decrepit, etc—remains locations of
		current encamped houseless populations. We can see the area around the current Amtrak station
		was home to the Amtrak encampment. Down 8th street, around the current location of the city’s
		recycling center, is a stretch of forest known as “The Hole” to encamped community members. A
		number of people formerly at Amtrak moved to The Hole when the City closed Amtrak. The area of
		Buzzard’s Glen/Poverty Flat is in a similar area that housed the City-sponsored campsite called
		Camp New Beginnings. The community members called it “Tent City.”
	</p>
	<p>
		The encamped population are a unique group of unhoused people in Lawrence. The majority of them
		have been unhoused for longer than two years, they are from Lawrence or have lived in Lawrence
		for a long time. Lawrence is their home. And yet, we currently do not value the way that they
		“settle” and “build.” Quite the contrary, most media coverage of encamped, unhoused populations
		use similar language to that used by newspapers regarding the East Bottoms. This project
		encourages us to recognize that all people in Lawrence, in the past and the present, have built
		this community.
